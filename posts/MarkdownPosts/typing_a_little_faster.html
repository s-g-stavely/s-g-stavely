            <p>I taught myself to type a bit faster over the course of a couple of months. I'd estimate that I spent 5 hours of effort to gain 10 to 20 words per minute (WPM) in speed.</p>
<p>Before I started, I mostly typed with only my thumb, index, and middle fingers. I'd learned to type without any formal practise, and like many people who are self-taught, I'd picked up some sub-optimal habits, like needing to look at my hands to locate some keys. After working a desk job for several years, I could type around 60 WPM, which was enough to get my job done. Once I was fast enough to do the work, I stopped improving.</p>
<p>Re-learning how to type was ultimately quite simple, and I did it in two stages. First, I learned how to touch type using all my fingers by following the lessons at <a href="https://www.typing.com">typing.com</a>. This felt weird at first, and it took a bit of time to &quot;rewire my brain&quot; enough to use the right fingers. Once I was confident I could touch type with all my fingers, albeit slowly, I used <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">Monkeytype</a> to practise to improve my speed.</p>
<p>It didn't take too long for me to be able to type fast enough that I could get my job done at roughly the same speed as before. With a little more practise, I was able to improve my speed beyond where I had started. This felt really cool!</p>
<p>So, why bother doing this? First, typing a little faster probably makes me a little more productive. When I'm writing, whether it's code or an email, I usually feel like I am in a loop that goes Think -&gt; Type -&gt; Think -&gt; Type -&gt; etc. If I speed up the typing segments, even a little, I'm saving meaningful amounts of time.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I think it makes typing more enjoyable. Programmers often talk about how, if a website takes just a few hundred milliseconds extra time to load, a lot of users will click away. I suspect that this same principle applies to writing text. If writing a message to a coworker feels like it's going to take a lot of effort, then I won't do it unless I really need to. By lowering the barrier in front of these tasks, I find myself doing them more often. I wanted to be able to write more easily, and being able to type faster was a simple way to do that.</p>

<li>While you're practising, I think you want to be careful not to allow yourself to &quot;get lazy&quot; by using the wrong fingers, or making lots of typos. If you're re-learning how to type anyway, you should try learn it correctly.</li>
<li>It also helped to learn some keyboard shortcuts. Ctrl+left and Ctrl+right jump around by words, and Ctrl+Backspace deletes an entire word. In retrospect, I was spending way too much time individually backspacing through words lol</li>
<li>I hate typing on my phone, and I'm really slow at it. As a result, I avoid sending text messages, and often wait until I'm at my computer to send IMs. Maybe I should work on this next?</li>
