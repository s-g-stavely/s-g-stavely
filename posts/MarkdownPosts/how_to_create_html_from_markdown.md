Zonelets is a tool for creating websites by editing html, found [here](https://zonelets.net/index.html).

1. Create your markdown file.
2. Use a markdown processor to turn it into a html file. I use the `Markdown All in One` extension in Visual Studio Code
3. Make a copy of the post template file and rename it
4. Open the generated html file. Copy the contents of the `<body>` tag into the `<body>` tag in the copied template file.
5. Update the script.js file with the name of your new post
